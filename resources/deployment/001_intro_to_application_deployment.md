# ðŸš€ Introduction to Application Deployment

Application deployment is a crucial process in software development that involves preparing and delivering applications from a development environment to a production environment or servers accessible by end users. The primary goal of application deployment is to ensure applications run smoothly and efficiently in the production environment and meet the needs of end users.

## Types of Deployment

Generally, there are several types of application deployment:

1. **Manual Deployment**: A manual process carried out by operational teams or developers.
   
2. **Continuous Deployment**: An automated approach enabling applications to be deployed continuously whenever there are changes in the application's repository.
   
3. **Serverless Deployment**: Using serverless architecture to run application code without managing traditional server infrastructure.

## Importance of Application Deployment

The application deployment process serves several key purposes:

- **Enhancing Availability**: Ensuring applications are accessible to end users with high availability.
  
- **Improving Performance**: Optimizing application performance in the production environment to enhance responsiveness and speed.
  
- **Reducing Downtime**: Minimizing the risk of downtime or service disruptions that could affect end users.
  
- **Scalability**: Providing flexibility to handle traffic spikes and capacity requirements.

## Deployment Platforms

There are various platforms available for application deployment, ranging from free to paid options, depending on project needs and scale. Each platform typically offers specific features that support effective application deployment processes.

In this module, we will focus on deployment platforms such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel, which are popular choices for modern web development projects.

Let's explore each of these platforms to understand how to use them and the benefits they offer in application deployment.
