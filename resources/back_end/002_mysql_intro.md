# MySQL Introduction
After learning about database design, you must be wondering how to put this knowledge into practice. Well, allow me to introduce MySQL, a very popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). 

ps : if youâ€™re wondering how to acces the GUI, just click this http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ (make sure apache and mysql is active).

## What is RDBMS???
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a specific type of database management systems (DBMS) that organizes data into tables with rows and columns. It enforces relationships between these tables through keys (usually primary keys and foreign keys), and it typically supports SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data. 

I don't think I need to go into too much detail about the RDBMS, since you guys have already learned that in the previous module, right?

## Important Terms in DBMS (Database Management System)
There are a few terms that you should be aware of when working with the database before we delve deeper into MySQL ~~codes~~:

- `Structured Query Language (SQL)`, This is the standard language for querying databases. It is a powerful language that can be used to perform complex queries.
- `Data Definition Language (DDL)`, This language is used to create and modify the structure of the database. It includes commands to create, delete, and alter tables and other database objects.
- `Data Manipulation Languages (DML)`, This is the language used to interact with the data in the database. It includes commands to insert, update, and delete data, or what we often heard of CRUD.

### These are some overview on MySQL
1. `Data Definition Language (DDL)`
    - __Creating Tables__: Learn to create tables using the CREATE TABLE statement.
    - __Altering Tables__: Understand how to modify existing tables using ALTER TABLE.
    - __Dropping Tables__: Learn how to delete tables using DROP TABLE.

2. `Data Manipulation Language (DML)`
    - __Inserting Data__: Practice inserting data into tables using the INSERT INTO statement.
    - __Updating Data__: Learn to update data in tables using the UPDATE statement.
    - __Deleting Data__: Practice removing data from tables using the DELETE statement.
