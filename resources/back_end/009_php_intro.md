# Introduction to PHP
### What is PHP?
PHP, which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is an open-source scripting language primarily used for server-side development. Its basic syntax is similar to many other programming languages, making it relatively easy to learn if you're familiar with other languages. For comprehensive guides on PHP's basic syntax, you can refer to various documentation and tutorials available online. 

Here are a few recommended resources:
- https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp (PHP Tutorial)
- https://youtu.be/TaBWhb5SPfc?si=eYieEwrYT9Oinwdd (TUTORIAL PHP DASAR BAHASA INDONESIA)

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-http-get-and-post-methods/ (Difference between HTTP GET and POST Methods)

In the initial setup guide `00a_setup`, you were instructed to download and install either XAMPP or Laragon. This ensures that your local environment is configured to run PHP and MySQL. Now that you have your environment set up, you're ready to dive into PHP development. 

Good luck and have fun!
