If you see at some web, we can see it has a different font style, size, color, etc. these are using *properties*.

at selector contents, it has a format of css that mention about properties, in properties section is the place to place any styling that css have.


## PROPERTIES
- ### format : 
```css
/* selector */ {
    /* properties: value */
}
```

- ### example:
```css
.name {
    display:flex;                                               -------+
    align-items: center;                                               |
    flex-wrap: wrap;                                                   |
    justify-content: space-around;                                     +----> these are `property: value`
    font-size: 25px;                                                   |
    font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;      |
    color: bisque;                                              -------+
