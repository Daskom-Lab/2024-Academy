Hello and welcome in **CSS** ^_^

Before we have learnt about skeleton making, now we're gonna give a skin so it has some appearance, let's go!!

## S E T U P

1. To add styling to your web, you must have stylesheet file, just make a new file with .css format at your web directory as for before it's "myWeb", 
   for example you can name it as "style.css".

2. After you make a new CSS file, now is the time to add stylesheet in your index.html file at the `<head>`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
```    
So your `<head>` component now will be:
```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">  <!-- I'm Here!! -->
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
```

All have been set! now we're gonna decorate your web at the next contents!!
