# All have been set!

Now we're gonna make the skeleton of web using HTML.

---
We have seen the teaser of HTML before while setting up the environment, and you can see there's a basic structure like:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
```

At that structure, there's some tag:
```html
<body> 
    *something*
</body>
```

at HTML, there's opening tag `<>` and closing tag `</>`, those tag states some section of the web like head, body, footer, div, etc.
between those tags are the contents of your web. Before we talk about those contents, we're gonna talk about the basic element.


## BASIC ELEMENT

See at the basic structure above! we'll talk about the tag:

- `<html>` : This element tells the browser that this *index.html* (for example) is HTML Document.
- `<head>` : Head element will have some information of the web/html:
<center>

| Tags | Description |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
|`<title>`| it defines the title of the document|
|`<style>`| used to define style information for a single document like|
|`<base>`| specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page|
|`<link>`| used to link to external style sheets|
|`<meta>`| used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings|
|`<script>`| used to define client-side JavaScripts|
|`<noscript>`| defines an alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support script|
</center>
  
- `<body>` : It contains all of the web contents like header, main, footer, and ohter section that developer has.

Aaaaaaaannnnnnnndddddddddddddddddddddd That's all for the **HTML**, next were gonna talk about *those* contents, Let's go!!!
