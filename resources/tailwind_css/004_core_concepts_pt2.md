# Core Concepts: Tailwind CSS

## 4.  Dark Mode üåô

**Explanation**:  
Tailwind CSS has built-in support for dark mode. You can use the `dark:` variant to style elements when dark mode is enabled.

**Example**:
```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-black text-black dark:text-white p-4">
  Dark mode example
</div>
```
In the example above [Dark Mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode)
:
- `dark:bg-black`: Changes the background color to black when dark mode is enabled.
- `dark:text-white`: Changes the text color to white when dark mode is enabled.


## 5. Reusing Styles ‚ôªÔ∏è

**Explanation**:  
Although Tailwind is utility-first, you can still create **custom classes** for reusable styles.

**Example**:
```html
<style>
  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
</style>

<button class="btn-primary">
  Reusable Button
</button>
```
In the example above [Reusing Styles](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles):

- `@apply` is used to combine several utility classes into a single custom class `btn-primary`.

That's it for part 2. Feel free to experiment with custom styles and any other ideas you have in mind. Good luck, and happy coding!
